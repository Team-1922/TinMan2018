# TinMan2018
**Due to an odd reaction between GitHub, Eclipse, and two other computers making simultaneous changes to the repository, we feel that GitHub is causing more problems than it is fixing. Because of this, this repository is not going to be used for the remainder of the build season. Once we feel that the code is complete, it will be uploaded here.**

2018: ~~The second year the code works~~

The year that CTRE changed the Java libraries mid season, on the year when we get all new programmers.

Instructions for setting up Eclipse, WPILib, and the other necessary programs are listed [here](https://github.com/Team-1922/TinMan2017/blob/master/README.md)
